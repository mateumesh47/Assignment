    "underscore (_). It cannot start with a number.\n",

    "2)No Reserved Keywords: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python’s reserved keywords (e.g., if, \n",
    "else, while, def,).\n",
    "Example: if and for are not allowed as identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Cannot Use Special Characters: Identifiers cannot contain special characters such as @, #, $, \n",
    "Example: total#amount is not allowed.\n",

    "4)No Spaces: Identifiers cannot have spaces. Use underscores to separate words if needed.\n",
    "Example: total_amount is valid, but total amount is not.\n",

    "Example: score and Score are different.\n",

    "6)Follow with Letters, Digits, or Underscores: After the first character, the identifier can \n",

    "statements belong to the same block of code. For example, all statements within an if statement\n",
    "or a for loop must be indented the same way.\n",
